# Exercise-02d-Scenes-And-Menus

Exercise for MSCH-C220

A user-controlled ship for a space-shooter game. Recently added the ability to shoot at asteroids. Created in Unity.

## Implementation
[1] - A background image as been set for all screens. The main menu having a different background than the play screen and end screen has also been added.

[2] - The background images were actually created by  myself and a friend.

[1] - A new enemy type has been added. This one moves in a Tan "wave" pattern, effectively teleporting it sometimes. This enemy moves slower while also moving left instead of right like the normal enemy. This enemy also shoots less frequently then the normal enemy.

[1] - Another enemy simply called "Boss" has been added. This enemy does not move and instead stays stationary at the bottom of the screen. It fires much larger bullets any significantly less frequent intervals. This enemy has a much larger pool of health and its bullets are much bigger. Defeating this enemy takes the player to a victory screen.
